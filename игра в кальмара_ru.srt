1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,879
When I say I was almost in Squid Game, I specifically mean Netflix's reality show version,

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:13,679
not like the actual one where people died. Sorry for a bit of a bait there, but also I'm not lying,

3
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,359
so before I get into that whole story, I need to explain how I was even put in that situation

4
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,560
to begin with. Early last year, Jacob, our friend Joe, my brother Jax, and I all went to this

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,480
little Squid Game pop-up event hosted by Netflix. It looked interesting, to say the least,

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,840
a combination of curiosity and boredom are what convinced us to buy tickets. Our Uber took us to

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,560
the location provided, and we were dropped off at a scary back alley in the streets of LA.

8
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:50,480
Are you sure this isn't a setup for, you know, the real thing? We hunted down the entrance,

9
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:57,200
headed up Squid Game themed stairs, and inside was a big lobby with merch, snacks, decorations.

10
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:03,040
You know what else was in there? No other human beings. We were the only ones there,

11
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:09,760
along with the shape guys that were just staring at us. Are you sure? This isn't- I don't know

12
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,560
anymore. Staff signed us in and gave us numbered wristbands. What? It's like Squid Game!

13
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,439
Eventually more contestants showed up, and soon enough we were hurried into the starting room,

14
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:25,519
decorated very much like no one actually cared about this thing. And if they did, corporate

15
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:29,920
ruined it. The staff guy gave us the rundown on how the event was going to work, all the rules,

16
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,920
such and such. But sprinkled throughout the explanation, we're like, a lot of safety hazard jokes.

17
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,439
I know the concept of the whole thing is rooted in playing dangerous games and dying, and ooh,

18
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:46,239
evil dystopian. But he was saying things like, don't lean on the walls. You might rip through it,

19
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,000
and I don't want to fill out any paperwork if you hurt yourself. Don't touch anything that you

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,520
shouldn't touch. I don't want to have to fill out paperwork again. He was very anti-paperwork,

21
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,760
like way more than the actual human safety part. Based on what we've seen so far, our group knew

22
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:08,560
we were about to experience exactly what we were hoping for, but with not the death part.

23
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,760
For the first game, what we were led into a room with lines of glass squares. What? It's like

24
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:19,039
Squid Game again, the glass jumping part. When it was your turn, the pattern on the 10 squares

25
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:25,519
would be shown, and you needed to memorize which tiles to step on. It's like, well, I guess it's

26
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:32,159
kind of like, Squid Game kind of. The first batch of people stepped up, the patterns all flashed.

27
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:37,759
But before anyone could begin stepping on glass, they were instructed to hold it, and only take

28
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:44,479
one step at a time. For the whole game, we had to watch everyone take one individual step,

29
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:51,919
stop, wait to be confirmed, then take one more step, for 10 spaces, in like, six groups total.

30
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:58,319
Also, I think that whatever mechanism they used to track if people were out or not was super

31
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:04,399
busted, because literally, only like five people in total got their pattern right. Joe, Jacob,

32
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,760
and Jacks all swore they memorized their pattern correctly, but were eliminated anyway.

33
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,879
I know I botched mine up though, I've got paper-shredder rain. They could give me one tile to memorize,

34
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,759
and I would still forget it. 25 of the 30 people failed their very first puzzle.

35
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:25,120
Now, Netflix knew that if people paid 40 bucks, yeah, 40, to be in this shitty

36
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,240
Squid Game event, and then had to go home after the first game, they would be pretty upset.

37
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,719
So the rule was, for the first four challenges, no one would be eliminated.

38
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:39,600
Yay, woohoo! Phew, that was a close one. In the next room, they tried to combine both the

39
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:45,439
Honeycomb Game and the Marbles Game from the show, but what was put together was throw marbles

40
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:50,719
in the shape on the table to win other people's marbles. It was very anti-glamactic.

41
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:56,160
Unfortunately, we were only able to gather in groups of three, so Joe wasn't able to join us.

42
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:02,079
Instead, he was paired up as a third wheel to a random couple that was obviously here on a date.

43
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:07,199
Jack's cleaned up shop on us, he got all our marbles within minutes, but over at Joe's table,

44
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:13,840
malicious injustice was afoot. Apparently, the two people that were in a romantic relationship

45
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,480
ganged up on Joe, and after taking all his marbles, just split them up between each other.

46
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:25,040
Despite there being no actual stakes in the game, Joe was furious simply out of principle

47
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,800
and swore to get revenge on them somewhere somehow. Before he could even start any beef,

48
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,000
we were brought into the next room, and again, we're split into groups this time of four.

49
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
They really liked group activities in this thing. Welcome through the doors to the challenge,

50
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,439
everyone was stationed around a respective gift coffin. After opening them up, it was revealed

51
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:50,800
we were going to be playing a big version of operation. The game where you try to pick up fake

52
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:56,879
little organs with fake medical tools without touching the sides, so simulated surgery.

53
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:02,560
Like, I guess that was kind of in squid game, at least they decorated the boxes like it,

54
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,040
but I mean, we're really pushing it at this point. Jacob and I randomly got paired up with

55
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:12,800
this married couple, and the four of us started inspecting the tools. When suddenly, the woman goes,

56
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:17,120
oh will you pass me the forceps? She's a surgeon.

57
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:24,800
Oh my god, we just happened to be paired up with a lady whose literal job was operation.

58
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,160
The challenge began and the three of us took our hands off the tools, she cracked her knuckles,

59
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:36,400
and we watched as all the plastic organs were suddenly out of the prop body. Not surprisingly,

60
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,160
our team was the first to finish. When we got back together with Joe and Jack,

61
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,000
we explained how we got super lucky to be paired up with an actual surgeon that literally

62
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,520
soloed the whole thing, and Joe was like, wait, that guy was a surgeon? And Jacob and I had to

63
00:05:51,520 --> 00:06:01,440
shake our heads and say, no Joe, she was a surgeon. Damn it. Now that we were entering the fourth

64
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,520
challenge, it was time to get serious. This was the first game where people would start getting

65
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:14,319
eliminated for realsies, but not realsies. Everyone was split into two groups and taken to one side of

66
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:21,359
a wall where there was a bunch of prop boats. It was a kind of not really IRL version of battleship

67
00:06:21,359 --> 00:06:26,399
where we had to try and shoot down all the other side's boats, and the team that one would progress

68
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:32,639
into the fifth game. I would describe this idea as good enough. Sure, you know, we didn't get to

69
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:38,319
choose where to put our boats since they were bolted to the floor, but I guess we did only pay 40 bucks

70
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:44,000
to be here. For some reason though, the staff member on our side was, we can call it extremely

71
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,599
helpful. At first he was saying general tips, like, so if they still have a four tile boat,

72
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:54,399
let's check all the areas that could fit that, you know, saying vague hints to help us out a bit.

73
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:59,279
But by the end of it, he was just straight up telling us if I were you guys, I wish you right here.

74
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:06,320
Like, this guy wanted us to win, and win fast, so either he had some kind of bet going on with

75
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:12,080
the other staff members, or dude just had places to be. All the other team's boats were sunk,

76
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:18,080
and the remaining 15 or so people were led into the semi-final game. It was obvious as soon as

77
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:25,520
we saw her. We were finally playing the classic red light green light. It was decorated like the

78
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:32,079
show the doll was there, but there were giant gift boxes scattered around the room to act as obstacles

79
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:37,759
because when you think about it, red light green light isn't high stakes when staff can't actually

80
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,079
shoot the contestants. Like, something had to be added to spice it up a bit. We gathered on the

81
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:48,159
starting line and the game started. As we were playing, I was thinking how are they measuring

82
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:53,599
if we're moving or not. You know, I doubt they recreated the entire motion tracking doll thing,

83
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:59,120
just for this pop-up that's getting torn down after a month. I figured the only thing they could

84
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:06,000
be using to track motion is our wristband, so in between the green lights, I focused extra hard

85
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,560
on making sure my wrist stayed as still as possible. In fact, I was focusing so hard on my wrist

86
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:18,000
that I didn't even realize I was the first one to pass the finish line. Unfortunately,

87
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,920
similarly to the jakey glass memory game, it seemed like a lot of the wristbands were super

88
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:29,920
wonky as well because a lot of people got pinged as eliminated no matter how still they were,

89
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:35,600
including Jacob and Jacks, which was a huge buzzkill. Either that or they were just built to be super

90
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:41,840
sensitive and somehow my weak little carpal tunnel wrists decided to not shake for the first time

91
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:49,200
in five years. I turned back to see just three people left, one of them being Joe. They all

92
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:56,240
lunged forward and as red light was called for the final time, I watched as Joe tripped and crashed

93
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:03,680
into them, causing every person left to topple to the floor. Their wristbands deemed them eliminated.

94
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,720
As Joe was walking past me to the dead area, I asked what happened to which he said,

95
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:16,560
I got him. Joe had intentionally sacrificed himself to bump those people because they were the

96
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:24,080
couple that ganged up on him during marbles. He had finally gotten his revenge. Was it petty?

97
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:30,240
Yes, did he probably ruin their date? Yes, but do I also not care and think that was the funnier

98
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:36,240
shit ever? Absolutely, Joe is awesome. I was somehow the only one in our group moving onto the

99
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,960
final round. Me and the other four winners of red light green light were brought into

100
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,600
Squid Game. And everyone else was there too, watching from behind a little rope.

101
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,279
Jaden, Squid Game is so rough and tough. How did you fare against the four other dudes that made it

102
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:56,960
to the end? In real Squid Game, the guy got stabbed. Did you get stabbed? You're probably wondering.

103
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:03,680
And oh dear viewer, no, I did not get stabbed. In fact, I didn't get hurt at all because Netflix

104
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:09,040
didn't want to deal with paperwork. Instead, we played, hold the fake egg on a spoon and attack

105
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,120
each other until there's one egg standing, but attack in a way where there's no paperwork,

106
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,520
which is fine with me because I doubt any of us actually knew how to play Squid Game anyway.

107
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:22,480
The buzzer rang and everyone started shifting around in the shape. Since I, for some reason,

108
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:29,040
have experienced in high stakes and game tournaments, I deployed my signature strategy of don't bring

109
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:34,240
attention to myself. I simply dodged and weaved between the guys swiping at each other's eggs.

110
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:40,559
I can take someone on in a 1v1, but any number higher and I've gone well past my capabilities.

111
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:44,480
Eventually, there are just three people left. The crowd started yelling,

112
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,519
get the girl, the girl's still in, and the two guys started walking towards me. But then

113
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,559
my personal peanut gallery chimed in with, hey, hey, hey, they're ganging up on the girl,

114
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,520
boom, shame, boom. And that flustered them enough to back away again.

115
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:05,200
Apparently, the power of teamwork and fear of misogyny can persevere through anything.

116
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:11,600
Suddenly, an egg hit the floor. It was just me and non-woman-hating guy number two.

117
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:18,240
The exact 1v1 I was trying to create. We circled each other. Both our spoon-holding arms stretched

118
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,880
out as far as they could go. He swung at my egg a couple times and I managed to dodge,

119
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:28,000
but I couldn't win this thing if I didn't go on the offense. Wait, what if I just...

120
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:37,919
I won the silly little Netflix Squid Game pop-up. The frontman came out and escorted me to the VIP

121
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:42,879
area where he gave me a plastic animal mask like in Squid Game. And we took awesome photos together

122
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:47,919
and I got an awesome t-shirt that said winner. And I didn't know it at the time, but as this was

123
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:52,799
happening, the staff pretended to shoot all the losers with fake gun sounds. Unfortunately,

124
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:59,760
I didn't get the 45.6 billion money prize like in the show. But along with the t-shirt,

125
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:06,560
they did give me a special form to fill out that would give me a priority application for Netflix's

126
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:13,040
actual Squid Game reality show. Squid Game, the challenge. Season 2. I looked at the form and thought,

127
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:19,040
you know, we'll just see what happens. Filled it out and was able to bring my friends back to

128
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:23,759
the VIP room with me because winning isn't fun unless you do it with your friends. That's what

129
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:28,799
Squid Game taught me. There were a bunch of snacks and alcoholic beverages in the winner area.

130
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:36,240
And I gotta say, the alcoholic squid drinks were probably the worst things I've ever tasted.

131
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:42,480
It was astonishing how bad they were. Over a year later, and I can... Oh, I can still imagine it.

132
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,279
I don't even know what ingredient could do that to a drink. Anyway, after I submitted my form,

133
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:53,519
I have expected to never hear anything about it ever again. But to my surprise, Netflix reached out

134
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:59,279
to interview me about potentially being a contestant on the show. In fact, I was forwarded to the next

135
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:05,199
round of interviews three times to completely break any potential rules of confidentiality. I was

136
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:10,399
starting to think there might be a chance I could actually be on the show. But eventually,

137
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:16,559
the interviews came to a stop, and I have come to the conclusion they have moved on to better qualifying

138
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:23,200
people. Most likely because I will admit I was a bit too honest during the interviews. They basically

139
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:29,680
all just looked like this. What kind of a role do you think you would play in Squid Game as a contestant?

140
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,880
I'd probably just be a follower. I don't like taking charge at all. How hard would you fight

141
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:41,600
to win Squid Game? Not that hard. Have you watched the first season of Squid Game the challenge?

142
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,920
No. Well, I watched the first 20 minutes, but I turned it off because I thought it was really

143
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:51,600
badly paced and boring. So that was that. And I'm okay with it. Or who knows? Maybe they saw my very

144
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:58,560
strange track record of winning game tournaments and got scared. It kind of seems like those kinds

145
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:05,360
of really intense and active game shows like real-life Squid Game end up having a lot of people complaining

146
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:11,200
about how they got hurt or weren't treated all that great anyway. So I'm glad I'm sitting safe

147
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,360
and sound in the comfort of my own home. I'm glad I'm not dealing with Squid Game related injuries.

148
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,320
In fact, also a very quick reminder that Techware Merch is going away soon. If you're late to

149
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,600
watching this video, it's probably already gone, to be honest. Sorry. I tried to warn you. Thanks

150
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,920
for watching though. And see you later.
